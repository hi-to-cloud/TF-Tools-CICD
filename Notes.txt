In jenkins there are few steps __> pre build, build, post build

pre build __> set up environment configuration
build __> perform actual stages
post build __> clean up, mandatory tasks after build stage done

2 Styles of ways of writing Pipeline
- scripted way __> old
- declarative way __> easy to write

agents __> if we want to test code in different flavors of OS environment (windows, linux, macos), mobile environment

jenkins ___> master & node
master __> linux
node __> agents __> different environment's

configure agent 
-----------------
1. when work is there, master calls agent, assign work __> Push Based Architecture __> launch agent via SSH
2. daily agent come online to master, ask work __> Pull Based Architecture __> lot of resources waste __> launch agent by connecting it to the controller


only Push Based Architecture is preferred while configure agents

Shell __> ${ NAME }
Ansible __> {{ NAME }}
Terraform __> var.NAME
jenkins __> ${ params.NAME }, $appVersion

Webhook inside github
---------------------
http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080/github-webhook/

Disable Node Monitoring
-----------------------
Dashboard __> Manage Jenkins __> Nodes __> Configure Node Monitors __> Don't mark agents temporarily offline __> save 

Setup Node
----------
Dashboard __> Nodes __> New node __> hi-to-cloud __> save

Setup Job
---------
Create IAM Role __> Admin Access __> Attach to Jenkins-Node

CI-CD
------
CI __> continuous integration __> push to artifactory
- install dependencies __> mvn install, npm install, pip install requirements.txt, ...etc __> .zip, .jar, .war
- upload zip/jar to artifactory __> jfrog, nexus

Devops Engineer __> Build tool & file only
---------------
- java __> maven __> pom.xml
- python __> pip __> requirements.txt
- NodeJS __> npm __> package.json
- .Net __> Nuget __> project.json

ZIP
---
zip -r <file-name> <what-files-add>
zip -q -r backend-${appVersion}.zip * 
-q is to quit logs generated while zip file

Nexus 
-----
Git __> code 
Nexus __> store artifacts

ssh -i vpn-001.pem ubuntu@nexus.step-into-iot.cloud

http://nexus.step-into-iot.cloud:8081/
admin 
Abc@12345
- enable anonymous access

maven artifactory
com.expense __> group id 
backend __> artifact id 
1.0.0 __> version

create maven2 hosted (mixed, Inline, Permissive, Allow redeploy)
http://nexus.step-into-iot.cloud:8081/repository/backend/

CI __> push to Nexus
http://nexus.step-into-iot.cloud:8081/repository/backend/com/expense/backend/1.0.0/backend-1.0.0.zip

CD __> Deploy to EC2
After CI __> CD need to be trigger 

CI __> up stream
CD __> down stream

CI we have appVersion __> send to CD with help of parameters
CD we have to take appVersion, pass to ansible playbook via pull mechanism
modify ansible roles to download package from nexus, configure ec2

Modify SG to allow from Jenkins

unit testing __> test the functionality of methods
Static Source Code Analysis __> scan code, give recommendations __> SonarQube
SAST __> Security related things, analysis given to developers, fix it
DAST __> Dynamic Security, real time attack code  internally
Open Source Libraries scan __> scan libraries, frequently upgraded to LTS version
Docker Image Scan __> Scan Docker Images

After this code __> Clean Code __> Deploy to Dev

Functional testing __> developers
integration testing __> perform by QA teams

SonarQube
---------
http://sonar.step-into-iot.cloud:9000/
admin 
instance-id 
Abc@12345

Inside Jenkins 
--------------
- Install sonar Scanner/sonar CLI/ sonar agent __> Tool 
Dashboard __> Manage Jenkins __> Tools __> SonarQube Scanner installations __> sonar __> Install automatically __> save 
- we need to configure it SonarQube Scanner
Dashboard __> Manage Jenkins __> system __> SonarQube installations __> sonar __> http://sonar.step-into-iot.cloud:9000 __> sonar-auth __> save

Why we are not Install all this NExus??
- Nexus use API calls internally __> curl to push artifact

Need to have this file in application code __> sonar-project.properties

Quality Gate 
------------
- overall code  __> prefer this
- new code 
its better to include both on quality gate __> set as default in UI 

if quality gate fail then jenkins pipeline need to fail
- sonarqube need to send information to jenkins __> webhook inside SonarQube __> http://jenkins.step-into-iot.cloud:8080/sonarqube-webhook/ __> create
